asgn06: mush

--------------------------------------------------
Special Instructions:
None

--------------------------------------------------
Other Information:

Known bugs:
- The first time the grep command is run, it sometimes produces an
  incorrect output. Sometimes it seems the parent also neglects to wait
  for the command to terminate. Note that both of these behaviors are
  inconsistent. After the first (erroneous) run of grep, all subsequent
  calls execute properly. This behavior has not been observed with any
  other commands.

Maximum macros implemented:
- the maximum length of the command line: 512 bytes
- the maximum length of the pipeline: 20
- the maximum number of arguments to any one command: 20

Additional commands implemented:
- "exit", "quit", and "q" will all terminate the shell

Your joke this time around:
"I started a band called 999 Megabytes — we haven’t gotten a gig yet."

And a fun fact!
I did all of my testing and handin submissions using my own mush ;)
